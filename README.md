## Getting Started With Conspectus

### Requirements
**Conspectus** is written in PHP. Make sure your server has PHP installed and configured.

### Download Conspectus
Download the repo from GitHub.
Psst, you can clone it, too. Fork it if you're really cool.

### Upload the files to your web server
Unzip the archive and upload the folder to your web server.
Rename the folder something like, uh, style-guide.
Make sure the folder has the proper permissions. Something like 755 (or, -rwxr-xr-x) should do.

### Edit config.json



### Review your style guide
Go to `yoursite.com/style-guide/` and see how your styles look.

### Create patterns


### Write documentation


### Ordering markup


### Customizing navigation
